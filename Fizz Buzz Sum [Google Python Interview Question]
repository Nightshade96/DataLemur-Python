Fizz Buzz Sum [Google Python Interview Question]
Write a function fizz_buzz_sum to find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below a target value.

For example, if the target value was 10, the multiples of 3 or 5 below 8 are 3, 5, 6, and 9.

Because 
3
+
5
+
6
+
9
=
23
3+5+6+9=23, our function would return 23.
Solution:
def fizz_buzz_sum(target):
  res = []
  for i in range(1,target):
    if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0:
      res.append(i)

  return sum(res)
