Largest Prime Factor [Facebook Python Interview Question]
Given a target number, write a function to return the largest prime factor of that target number.

For example, for the number 42, the prime factors are 2, 3, and 7, so we'd return 7 because that's the largest prime factor.

For the number 25, it's prime factors are 5 and 5, so we'd return 5.
Solution:
def largest_prime_factor(target):
  factors = []
  divisor = 2
  while target > 2:
    while target % divisor == 0:
      factors.append(divisor)
      target //= divisor
    divisor += 1
  return factors[-1]
  
  """
Solution
def largest_prime_factor(target):
  i = 2
  while i * i <= target:
      if (target % i) != 0:
          i += 1
      else:
          target //= i
  return target"""
