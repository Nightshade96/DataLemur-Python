Missing Integer [Amazon Python Interview Question]
Amazon
Given an input list containing 
�
n distinct numbers in the range 0 to 
�
n, return the only number in the range that is missing from the list.

For example, given input = [0,1,3], return 2. Because the input list has 3 elements in it, we expect to see the numbers 0 to 3 in there, but 2 is missing.

Another example: given input = [4, 3, 2, 1], return 0. We return 0 becuase the input list has 4 elements in it, so we expect to see the numbers 0 to 4 in there, but 0 itself is missing!

Solution:
def missing_int(input: list[int])-> int:
  input = sorted(input)
  for i in range(0,len(input)):
    if i != input[i]:
      return i
  return len(input)
