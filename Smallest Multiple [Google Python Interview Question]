Smallest Multiple [Google Python Interview Question]
Write a function smallest_multiple to find the smallest number that is perfectly divisible (i.e. no remainder) by all numbers from 1 to the target number.

For example, if the target value was 5, we'd return 60, because 60 is evenly divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. There is no number smaller than 60 which satisfies this condition.

Solution:
def smallest_multiple(target):
    for i in range(2, 1000000,2):
        divisible = True
        for j in range(1, target + 1):
            if i % j != 0:
                divisible = False
                break
        if divisible:
            return i
"""
def smallest_multipleSmaller(target):
    for i in range(target, 1000000, target):
        divisible = all(i % j == 0 for j in range(1, target + 1))
        if divisible:
            return i
